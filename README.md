# FountainAI FastAPI Proxy

This repository contains the source code for the **FastAPI Proxy** that serves as the communication interface between the **custom GPT model** and the **GitHub repository** used by the **FountainAI** platform. The proxy provides secure, non-destructive access to the GitHub API, allowing the GPT model to retrieve repository metadata, commit history, pull requests, and other repository insights in real-time.

## Features
- **Non-destructive access**: The proxy enables safe, read-only access to the GitHub repository, ensuring that no changes are made to the repository during data retrieval.
- **Real-time feedback**: The proxy allows the custom GPT model to monitor repository activity and provide real-time feedback on commits, pull requests, and issues.
- **Secure communication**: Using SSH keys for secure communication between the Lightsail instance and GitHub ensures seamless synchronization between the repository and the deployment server.

## Deployed Proxy

The FastAPI Proxy is deployed and can be accessed at:  
**[Deployed Proxy Server](https://proxy.fountain.coach)**

For details on how this proxy fits into the broader **FountainAI** infrastructure, refer to the **FountainAI Book**.

## Documentation

This repository serves as both the codebase and the documentation hub for the FastAPI Proxy. Detailed instructions for deploying and managing the proxy are outlined in the **FountainAI Book**.

- **Chapter 10**: Describes the integration of the custom GPT model with GitHub’s OpenAPI, setting the foundation for real-time feedback and introspection.  
- **Chapter 11**: Provides a comprehensive guide for deploying the FastAPI Proxy and configuring the secure push-pull workflow with GitHub.  
  - Direct link to Chapter 11: [Deploying the FastAPI Proxy](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-Book/blob/main/chapters/chapter11.md)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the FastAPI Proxy, ensure the following:
- **Python 3.8+** is installed on your machine or server.
- **Git** is set up to clone this repository and sync with GitHub.
- **SSH keys** are configured for secure communication between your server and GitHub.

### Installation

To set up and run the FastAPI Proxy, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Contexter/fountainai-fastapi-proxy.git
   cd fountainai-fastapi-proxy
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI app:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. For production use, configure **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and set up the proxy as a **systemd service** for automatic startup.

For more detailed installation and deployment instructions, refer to **Chapter 11** of the **FountainAI Book**:  
[Deploying the FastAPI Proxy](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-Book/blob/main/chapters/chapter11.md)

## Deployment

The FastAPI Proxy can be deployed on AWS Lightsail or other similar platforms. A comprehensive deployment guide, including setting up SSH keys, configuring Nginx, and securing the app with **Let’s Encrypt SSL**, can be found in **Chapter 11** of the **FountainAI Book**.
